Creates a list called my_list
Adds and inserts elements.- adds 10,20,30,40,40,50,60,70 and 80 to the list

Add an element at a specific index ie 25 at index 1 and the my_list now becomes: [10, 25, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

Extends the list with additional values  90,100,110  and my_list becomes: [10, 25, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110]

Removes the last element and my_list becomes: [10, 25, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100,]

Sorts the list in ascending order- sorts my list in an ascending order   my_list becomes: [10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

Finds the index of 70 and prints it- The first occurrence of 70 in the sorted list is at index 9.

# Output:
Index of 70: 9
